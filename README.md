CS Coursework 2022
This is my Computer Coursework for the 2022 exams, my coursework revolves around using the py game libary in order to work.
The game which I choose to make is done in homarage to flappy bird which holds a special place for me in terms of computer science.
This is due to the fact the first computer program (if you can call it that) was a recreation of the game on scratch.
Just seems fitting that I should end my CS school journey at ground zero where it started.
